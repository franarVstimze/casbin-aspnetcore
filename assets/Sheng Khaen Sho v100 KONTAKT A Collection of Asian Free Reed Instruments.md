# Sheng Khaen Sho v1.0.0 KONTAKT: A Collection of Asian Free Reed Instruments
 
Sheng Khaen Sho v1.0.0 KONTAKT is a sample library that features three traditional Asian free reed instruments: the Chinese Sheng, the Laotian Khaen, and the Japanese Sho. These instruments have a common ancestor and produce sound by both inhaling and exhaling, resulting in an almost endless sustained sound or a quick rhythmic pulsing. The library offers full breath control for lifelike performances, as well as a microtune module, custom effects, and sound design presets.

- "Great product at a competitive price. Soniccouture did an excellent job of helping the user be aware of natural instrument range and to easily switch between that and extended range coverage. Not all of these were chromatic or even diatonic originally. A lot of historical research went into this library as well. A truly high class offering."[^2^]
- "Soniccouture have faithfully recreated these instruments for Kontakt, using innovative inhale / exhale sampling techniques, which allow the user to add natural expression and modulation. A full set of envelopes, LFOs, and filters add creative sound design possibilities."[^1^]
- "The library offers full breath control for lifelike performances, as well as a microtune module, custom effects, and sound design presets. The library is compatible with the free KONTAKT PLAYER and supports NKS, which connects KOMPLETE KONTROL keyboards, MASCHINE hardware, and third-party controllers to hundreds of software instruments and effects."[^3^]
